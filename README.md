# Requirements 

Python 3.6.9 or above 

A huntsformovie repo will need a python environment with a requirements.txt

Access this at following URL

The requirements.txt file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks depend on, and they will be installed using:

 pip install -r requirements.txt
